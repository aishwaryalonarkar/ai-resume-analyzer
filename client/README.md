# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### **Current Limitations**

As with any AI-powered tool, it's important to acknowledge the current limitations. This project is a proof-of-concept and should be used as a supplementary guide, not as a definitive measure of a candidate's suitability.

*   **Dependency on LLM Accuracy:** The entire analysis (JD match, missing keywords, summary) is generated by the Gemini Pro model. LLMs can sometimes misunderstand context, hallucinate information, or have inherent biases from their training data. The results are a great starting point but should always be reviewed by a human.

*   **PDF Parsing Challenges:** The accuracy of the analysis is highly dependent on the quality of text extracted from the PDF. Resumes with:
    *   Complex multi-column layouts
    *   Heavy use of graphics or images
    *   Unconventional fonts or formatting
    
    ...may not be parsed correctly, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results. A clean, single-column, text-based resume will yield the best outcome.

*   **Lack of Deeper Context:** The model analyzes only the text provided. It cannot understand the nuance of company culture, the specific needs of a hiring team, or the relative importance of different skills beyond what is explicitly stated in the job description.

*   **Keyword vs. Experience:** While the tool identifies "missing keywords," a great resume is about showcasing impact and experience, not just keyword stuffing. The suggestions should be used to ensure your relevant experience is communicated using the language the recruiter is looking for.

### **Future Scope & Advancements**

This project has a rich roadmap for future development. Here are some of the features and improvements we envision:

*   **Interactive Resume Suggestions:** Instead of just listing missing keywords, the tool could suggest specific sentences or bullet points. For example: "Consider adding a point about your experience with 'CI/CD pipelines' in your Project X description."

*   **Support for Multiple Formats:** Add support for uploading `.docx`, `.txt` files, or even analyzing a LinkedIn profile URL directly.

*   **Batch Analysis:** Allow a user to upload one resume and check it against multiple job descriptions simultaneously to identify their best-fit opportunities.

*   **Resume Versioning:** Enable users to save different versions of their resume and track which one performs better for specific types of roles.

*   **Interview Question Generation:** Based on the resume and the job description, generate a list of potential technical and behavioral interview questions the candidate might face.

*   **Enhanced UI/UX:** A more dynamic user interface showing a side-by-side comparison of the resume and the job description, with highlighted sections and more detailed visualizations.

*   **Fine-Tuning a Custom Model:** For superior accuracy, fine-tuning a dedicated model on a curated dataset of resume-JD pairs would be the ultimate goal, reducing reliance on the general-purpose Gemini Pro and providing more domain-specific insights.
