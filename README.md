# AI Resume Analyzer + Job Match Scorer

AI Resume Analyzer + Job Match Scorer is a web application designed to help job seekers assess how well their resume aligns with a given job description. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques implemented using Python and NLTK, this tool calculates a similarity score, highlights keyword gaps, and provides actionable suggestions to improve resume relevance.

The system consists of a React frontend for user interaction and a Python backend API for processing and analysis.

---

## Features

- Upload or paste resume and job description text inputs  
- Calculates a similarity score indicating the match between resume and job description  
- Highlights missing or underrepresented keywords and skills in the resume  
- Provides a detailed keyword coverage and alignment breakdown  
- Implements NLP processing entirely in the backend using NLTK  
- Privacy focused — no third-party API calls or data leakage  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **NLP:** NLTK (tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF vectorization)  
- **API:** RESTful communication between frontend and backend  

---

## How It Works

1. Users enter their resume and a target job description in the React frontend UI.  
2. The frontend sends the input texts to the backend API.  
3. The backend preprocesses the texts using NLTK: tokenizing, stemming, removing stopwords.  
4. TF-IDF vectors are computed for both texts.  
5. Cosine similarity between the vectors is calculated to produce a match score.  
6. Keywords present in the job description but missing or rare in the resume are identified.  
7. The backend returns the match score and keyword analysis to the frontend.  
8. The frontend displays the results with clear visual feedback and suggestions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer  
- Node.js (v16 or newer) and npm  

---

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-resume-analyzer.git
   cd ai-resume-analyzer/backend
   ```  
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```  
3. Install required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Run the Flask backend server:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  
   By default, this runs the backend on `http://localhost:5001`.  

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window/tab.  
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:  
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```  
3. Install npm dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  
4. Start the React development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  
   The frontend will be served on `http://localhost:3000`.  

---

## Usage Instructions

- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.  
- Enter or paste your resume text into the Resume input box.  
- Enter or paste the job description text into the Job Description input box.  
- Click the Generate Score button to send the data to the backend for processing.  
- View the computed match score and keyword analysis results displayed on the page.  
- Use the suggestions to refine and tailor your resume for the job description.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Python version is 3.8 or higher.  
- Verify that all backend dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
- If the frontend fails to start, check that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.  
- Use developer tools and terminal logs to debug API communication issues.

### **Current Limitations**

As with any AI-powered tool, it's important to acknowledge the current limitations. This project is a proof-of-concept and should be used as a supplementary guide, not as a definitive measure of a candidate's suitability.

*   **Dependency on LLM Accuracy:** The entire analysis (JD match, missing keywords, summary) is generated by the Gemini Pro model. LLMs can sometimes misunderstand context, hallucinate information, or have inherent biases from their training data. The results are a great starting point but should always be reviewed by a human.

*   **PDF Parsing Challenges:** The accuracy of the analysis is highly dependent on the quality of text extracted from the PDF. Resumes with:
    *   Complex multi-column layouts
    *   Heavy use of graphics or images
    *   Unconventional fonts or formatting
    
    ...may not be parsed correctly, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results. A clean, single-column, text-based resume will yield the best outcome.

*   **Lack of Deeper Context:** The model analyzes only the text provided. It cannot understand the nuance of company culture, the specific needs of a hiring team, or the relative importance of different skills beyond what is explicitly stated in the job description.

*   **Keyword vs. Experience:** While the tool identifies "missing keywords," a great resume is about showcasing impact and experience, not just keyword stuffing. The suggestions should be used to ensure your relevant experience is communicated using the language the recruiter is looking for.

### **Future Scope & Advancements**

This project has a rich roadmap for future development. Here are some of the features and improvements we envision:

*   **Interactive Resume Suggestions:** Instead of just listing missing keywords, the tool could suggest specific sentences or bullet points. For example: "Consider adding a point about your experience with 'CI/CD pipelines' in your Project X description."

*   **Support for Multiple Formats:** Add support for uploading `.docx`, `.txt` files, or even analyzing a LinkedIn profile URL directly.

*   **Batch Analysis:** Allow a user to upload one resume and check it against multiple job descriptions simultaneously to identify their best-fit opportunities.

*   **Resume Versioning:** Enable users to save different versions of their resume and track which one performs better for specific types of roles.

*   **Interview Question Generation:** Based on the resume and the job description, generate a list of potential technical and behavioral interview questions the candidate might face.

*   **Enhanced UI/UX:** A more dynamic user interface showing a side-by-side comparison of the resume and the job description, with highlighted sections and more detailed visualizations.

*   **Fine-Tuning a Custom Model:** For superior accuracy, fine-tuning a dedicated model on a curated dataset of resume-JD pairs would be the ultimate goal, reducing reliance on the general-purpose Gemini Pro and providing more domain-specific insights.
